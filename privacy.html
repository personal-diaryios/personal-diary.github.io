    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: October 2025</em></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Personal Diary – Mood Journal app collects and uses information. By using the app you agree to this policy.</p>

    <h2>What we collect</h2>
    <h3>Personal information</h3>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store personal information (name, email, phone) or your diary content unless you provide it to us (for example, when sending feedback).</p>

    <h3>Non-personal information</h3>
    <p>We may collect anonymous, non-personal data to improve the app, such as device model, OS version, crash reports, and aggregated usage statistics.</p>

    <h3>Session data</h3>
    <p>We may record session details (connectivity, access times, error logs). This does not include diary contents.</p>

    <h3>Analytics & ads</h3>
    <p>We may use third-party analytics (e.g., Google Analytics / Firebase). The free app may show ads from providers such as AdMob. These services may use device identifiers for analytics or ad personalization. You can disable personalized ads in your device settings.</p>

    <h2>Local storage and iCloud</h2>
    <p>Your diary entries, photos, moods, and tags are stored locally on your device. If you enable iCloud Backup, your data is stored in your personal iCloud account. We (the developers) do not access your iCloud data.</p>

    <h2>Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent personal data. We may share anonymized aggregate data with analytics or ad providers.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect data, but no system is completely secure. Please avoid storing extremely sensitive information.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. Contact us to remove data if needed.</p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>If you are in the EU or California, you may have rights regarding data access or deletion. Since we do not collect personal data by default, most rights will not apply, but you can contact us with requests.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have privacy questions, email: <a href="mailto:diary-ios@outlook.com">diary-ios@outlook.com</a></p>
