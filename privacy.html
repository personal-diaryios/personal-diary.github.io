  <h3>4. Analytics Services</h3>
  <p>We may use third-party analytics tools like Google Analytics or Firebase to understand general usage patterns. This data is aggregated and anonymous.</p>

  <h3>5. Advertising</h3>

  <h2>IV. iCloud Backup (Optional)</h2>
  <p>If you enable iCloud Backup, your diary data is stored securely within your personal iCloud account associated with your Apple ID. We (the app developers) <strong>do not have access</strong> to this data. All iCloud operations are managed by Apple’s CloudKit and are subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
